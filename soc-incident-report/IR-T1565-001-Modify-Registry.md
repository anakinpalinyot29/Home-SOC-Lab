## 🧠 3. Technique Overview (MITRE ATT&CK)

### Technique: Stored Data Manipulation – Modify Registry (T1565.001)

Attackers may **modify registry values** to:
- Alter system behavior
- Disable security features
- Achieve persistence
- Manipulate application or OS configurations

Registry modifications are particularly dangerous because they:
- Often persist across reboots
- May not generate visible user-facing symptoms
- Can silently weaken endpoint security

---

## 🎯 4. Detection Objective

The objective of this detection rule is to identify **unauthorized or suspicious registry modifications** that could indicate:

- Persistence mechanisms
- Defense evasion
- Impact on system or application behavior
